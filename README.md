# debian-playbook

My Ansible Playbook for Debian! This project is reminiscent of another project I worked on [here](https://github.com/ToYoNiX/debian-project). Back in the day, I didn't know what I was doing and it was mostly for fun. However, It tought me a lot and put me on the direction I am on now. I want this one to be something permanent, something that I could put to test and improve upon, and finally something to put my knowledge to the test!

# My Goal

My goal here is to create a playbook that I can use for maintaining debian systems, install and configure them as I would like, and also help me to grasp ansible more.

# Contribution

I am open for any contribution, from a simple bug fix all the way up to a full feature implementation! Just create a fork, do you stuff then open a pull request! Look for issues if you don't know what to do.
